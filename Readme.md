## Challenges & Solutions üß†

Building KorsiSher was not only about delivering Persian poetry to users but also navigating through various technical challenges:

1. **Dependency Injection Across Platforms**:
  - **Android**: Used Hilt for DI, maximizing its seamless integration and scalability.
  - **iOS**: Crafted a pattern to mirror Hilt's functionality in iOS, ensuring consistent DI across platforms.

2. **Database Management**:
  - **Android**: Employed Room for a robust SQLite object mapping experience.
  - **iOS**: Integrated SqlDelight, facilitating smooth database interactions and shared SQL code.

3. **Unified Business Logic**:
  - Aiming to share as much business logic as possible, including ViewModels. With Android ViewModel offering distinct advantages, adapting this logic to iOS posed challenges and required thoughtful solutions.

4. **Kotlin Asynchrony & iOS**:
  - Kotlin's Flow and Coroutine are go-to tools for asynchronous tasks on Android. To utilize these on iOS, we designed custom wrappers ensuring smooth asynchronous operations on both platforms.

5. **Cross-platform Networking with Ktor**:
  - Implementing Ktor for networking was a significant step in maintaining consistent data interactions between Android and iOS. It required a deep understanding and adjustments to address platform-specific nuances.

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

- **Kotlin Multiplatform**: Shared business logic across Android and iOS, ensuring consistent behavior and minimized code duplication.
- **Android**:
  - Jetpack Compose for a contemporary UI.
  - Hilt for dependency injection.
  - Clean Architecture for a structured, maintainable framework.
- **iOS**:
  - SwiftUI for a native and fluid UI experience.
